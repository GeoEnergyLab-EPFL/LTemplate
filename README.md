# LTemplate

**Note:** If you plan to use LTemplate, please send me an email and let me know about your use case. If I know how people use it, I can be more careful with breaking changes. 

This is a package that simplifies extending _Mathematica_ through LibraryLink by automating the generation of boilerplate code.

To install, drop the `LTemplate` directory in the directory opened by `SystemOpen@FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]`.

See `Documentation/LTemplateTutorial.nb` for a short introduction through examples.

For an example of an application that uses LTemplate, see [IGraph/M](https://github.com/szhorvat/IGraphM).
