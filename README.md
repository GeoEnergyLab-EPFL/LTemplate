# LTemplate

This is a package that simplifies extending _Mathematica_ through LibraryLink by automating the generation of boilerplate code.

To install, drop the `LTemplate` directory in the directory opened by `SystemOpen@FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]`.

See `Documentation/LTemplateTutorial.nb` for a short introduction through examples.

For an example of an application that uses LTemplate, see [IGraph/M](https://github.com/szhorvat/IGraphM).
