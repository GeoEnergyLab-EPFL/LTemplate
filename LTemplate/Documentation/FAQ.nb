Can I use LTemplate to generate an interface to an existing class?\

No. Just like library functions, LTemplate classes must follow certain \
conventions.\

LTemplate requires the use of C++. It is the features that C++ provides over \

Originally, LTemplate was created to make it easy to set up managed library \
